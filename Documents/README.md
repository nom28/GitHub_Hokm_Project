This project was a small school git project with communications to a server that a different group of students have done.
Hence, the code to the server is not included in this repository.

It was definatly a good experiance to use github for the first time and learn how to use it in an efficant way.
it does have some not so beutiful commits and code, as it was the first time using this tool.

The code was written by: Amihai Ratzon, Adar Gleizer, Noam Schuldiner and with the kind help of Idan Gur.
